# Week2
An end-to-end project for forecasting electric vehicle (EV) adoption using time-series analysis and machine learning. This repository uses Washington State registration data to clean, visualize, and engineer features. It compares Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to predict future county-level EV counts to aid in infrastructure planning.
