# Week2
An end-to-end project for forecasting electric vehicle (EV) adoption using time-series analysis and machine learning. This repository uses Washington State registration data to clean, visualize, and engineer features. It compares Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models to predict future county-level EV counts to aid in infrastructure planning.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a data science project focused on forecasting the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). As EV adoption surges, urban planners and policymakers require accurate forecasts to anticipate infrastructure needs, particularly for charging stations. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to predict future EV counts based on historical registration data.

The analysis uses a dataset of monthly EV registrations from Washington State, performing everything from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to time-series feature engineering. It implements and compares two powerful ensemble models, **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting**, to generate reliable forecasts.

## üìã Problem Statement

Using a real-world electric vehicle dataset, this project aims to create a robust regression model to forecast future EV adoption. The goal is to predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on historical trends, helping to inform and guide infrastructure planning.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is the "Electric Vehicle Population By County" dataset, which contains monthly counts of registered vehicles from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

-   **Key Features:** `Date`, `County`, `State`, `Vehicle Primary Use`, `Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)`, `Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)`, and `Electric Vehicle (EV) Total`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The dataset is loaded, data types are corrected, and missing values are handled. Outliers in the `Percent Electric Vehicles` feature are capped using the IQR method.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are created to understand the overall trend of EV adoption over time and the breakdown of vehicle types (BEV vs. PHEV).
3.  **Feature Engineering:** To prepare the data for time-series forecasting, several features were created for each county:
    * **Time-Based Features:** `year`, `month`, `months_since_start`.
    * **Lag Features:** EV totals from 1, 2, and 3 months prior.
    * **Rolling Features:** 3-month rolling average of EV totals.
    * **Growth Features:** Percentage change in EV count and a rolling growth slope.
4.  **Modeling and Evaluation:**
    * Two models were trained: **Random Forest Regressor** (tuned with `RandomizedSearchCV`) and a **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.
    * The models were evaluated and compared using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **R¬≤ Score** on a time-based test set.
5.  **Forecasting:** The best-performing model is used to generate a 3-year forecast for specific counties, visualizing both the monthly and cumulative adoption trends.

## üìà Key Results & Visualizations

The model achieves a very high R¬≤ score on the test set, demonstrating strong performance, particularly in predicting stable, low-growth counties.

**1. Comparative Feature Importance:**
The models identified recent historical data (`ev_total_lag2` and `ev_total_lag1`) as the most important predictors.
